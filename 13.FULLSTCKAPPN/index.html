    <!--now i have written code for fornt end and backend. Starting backend as well but how to host front end??
     for that we need to make our frontend go online on INTRANET 

     MAKING OUR FILES GO ONLINE ~ SERVING/HOSTING OUR FILES ON HTTP
     FOR THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE PYTHON INSTALLLED AND GO TO FOLDER YOU WANNA HOST
     RUN(npx serve)                serves the files on HTTP
     we did this so that we can get an easy domain address of frontend!

     start both on diff terminal by node index.js      and        npx serve         from same directory
      


     //if you send req they ll be blocked by CORS but you can send and recieve answers successfully by postman 
     since vulnerability exists only in browsers!
