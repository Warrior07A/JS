THEN,
• What is Schema?
    it is a structured way of telling to DB what our data would be looking like inside our tables!
    E.G.users{
        name:"string",
        emaail:"string"          ..............
    }

• NO SQL IS BETTER THAN SQL since it has Schema Flexibility  (you don't need to define the schema)

• what is a cluster?
A bunch of machines holding our data are called CLUSTERS


QUES: what is the differneve between NOSQL AND SQL?

    NOSQL is (Schema less)
    SQL (Needs Schema to be defined)
    Then why did we defined schema in mongo here??        We need the data schema to be strict and follow a certain order that's why we used mongooose
                                                            IF we use mongodb we dont need a schema
